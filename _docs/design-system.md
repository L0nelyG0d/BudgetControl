# Design system

Read this before touching any UI. Use the tokens and components below; never hardcode colors, spacing, or font sizes in components.

## Approach
- shadcn/ui on Tailwind CSS (v4) with Radix primitives, in the React + TypeScript app under `frontend/`
- Add components with `npx shadcn@latest add <name>`. They are copied into `frontend/src/components/ui/` and are our code: edit them there, don't wrap them in extra layers
- Reuse a shadcn component before writing a custom one
- Style: clean and minimal. The numbers are the content, so keep chrome quiet. One accent color, flat cards, plenty of whitespace

## Approved packages
Approved once; the agent may install these without asking:
- `tailwindcss`, `@tailwindcss/vite`, `tw-animate-css`
- `class-variance-authority`, `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`
- `lucide-react` (icons)
- the `@radix-ui/*` packages that shadcn components require
- `sonner` (toasts)
- `recharts` (charts)
- `react-router-dom` (routing, task 9)

Any other dependency still needs the user's approval first.

## Themes and tokens
- Light and dark, following the system setting (`prefers-color-scheme`). Every color is a CSS variable, so components never contain theme-specific code
- Tokens live in `frontend/src/index.css`: light under `:root`, dark under `.dark` (applied from the system setting)
- Use Tailwind classes that read the tokens (`bg-background`, `text-muted-foreground`, `border-border`, `bg-primary`). Never write raw hex values in components

| Token | Light | Dark | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--background` | `#F8FAFC` | `#0F172A` | page background |
| `--card` | `#FFFFFF` | `#1E293B` | cards, tables, forms |
| `--border` | `#E2E8F0` | `#334155` | dividers, input borders |
| `--foreground` | `#0F172A` | `#F1F5F9` | main text |
| `--muted-foreground` | `#64748B` | `#94A3B8` | labels, notes |
| `--primary` | `#4F46E5` | `#818CF8` | primary buttons, links (indigo) |
| `--primary-foreground` | `#FFFFFF` | `#0F172A` | text on primary |
| `--ring` | `#4F46E5` | `#818CF8` | focus ring |
| `--destructive` | `#B91C1C` | `#F87171` | errors, over budget, delete |
| `--success` | `#15803D` | `#4ADE80` | saved, within budget (custom token) |

Text must meet WCAG AA contrast (4.5:1) in both themes. Check any new color pair before using it.

## Typography, spacing, shape
- System font stack, no web fonts. Body text 16px; labels and table text 14px; helper text 12px
- Weights: 400 body, 600 headings and totals
- Use Tailwind's default spacing scale only. No arbitrary values like `p-[13px]`
- Radius from `--radius`: `0.5rem` for inputs and buttons, `0.75rem` for cards
- Page content: `max-w-4xl`, centered, 16px side padding on mobile
- Mobile-first. Tables scroll horizontally inside their own container; the nav stays on one row

## Money and numbers
- Currency is always tenge. Format with `Intl.NumberFormat('ru-KZ', { style: 'currency', currency: 'KZT', maximumFractionDigits: 0 })`, which gives `1 500 ₸`. Use one shared `formatMoney()` helper; never format by hand
- Amounts are whole tenge integers (see `_docs/plan.md`). No decimals anywhere in the UI
- Right-align amounts in tables and use `tabular-nums` so digits line up
- Dates: `DD.MM.YYYY` in lists. Months in headings are written out ("October 2026")

## Components
Use these shadcn components for these jobs:

| Need | Component |
|---|---|
| Buttons | `Button` (one primary per screen; `outline` for secondary; `destructive` for delete) |
| Text fields | `Input` with `Label` always visible above it (no placeholder-only labels) |
| Forms and validation | `Form` (react-hook-form) with the error text below the field |
| Category picker | `Select` |
| Lists of expenses and budgets | `Table` |
| Grouping | `Card` |
| Delete confirmation | `AlertDialog`, saying what will happen (e.g. "Expenses will move to Other") |
| Save feedback | `Sonner` toast, short success or error. No `alert()` |
| Pie chart | `Chart` (Recharts) |

Every list and page has three states: loading (`Skeleton`), empty (a hint about what to do next), and error (with a retry button). Disable the submit button while a request is in flight.

## Charts
- Pie slices use each category's own `color` from the database, so a category looks the same everywhere
- Include a legend with category name and amount. Never rely on color alone
- Show a clear empty state ("No expenses this month") instead of an empty chart

## Budget status
- Never color alone. Status is a color plus an icon and a text label:
  - within budget: `--success`, check icon, "Within budget"
  - over budget: `--destructive`, warning icon, "Over by 12 000 ₸"
- Progress bars show spent / budget; cap the fill at 100% and show the overage as text

## Accessibility
- Every input has a label; every icon-only button has an `aria-label`
- Keep the visible focus ring on all interactive elements. Never remove outlines
- Everything works with the keyboard. Dialogs trap focus and close with Escape (Radix does this; don't break it)
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`

## Tone
- Sentence case for buttons, headings, and labels ("Add expense", not "Add Expense")
- Error messages say what happened and how to fix it ("Email is already registered. Try logging in instead.")
- No exclamation marks, no jargon
